<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Me

[![A Interesting Video][product-screenshot]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB7ACr7pUuE)

My Name (Online Name just in case you are confused) is AspectFX/Prokid999 And I am a github user that codes stuff and does stupid things sometimes.

List of my accomplishments/skills so far:
* I am the person who pioneered and popularized hacking on eaglercraft(https://github.com/AspectFX/eaglercraft) (I don't recommend hacking btw, it's just something I did)
* Average VsCode and Linux User
* Python and HTML/JS Experience, and messed around with some Lua just because I wanted to try it

My Discord is: !Glitched;+-#1080 Don't Worry If you can't dm me it means I changed usernames, Just wait until I update this page, it will happen lol.

Anyways have fun looking through my profile, It has like 120+ repos in it (Most that I just forked). But it should give you some joy to look through them and be suprised with it.
